                <details>
                    <summary>1. Submit Commission Form</summary>
                    <p>Fill out my commission form when I&#39;m open. I'll post announcements and/or change my username to let people know that I'm open.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>2. Get Chosen</summary>
                    <p>Behind the scenes I score client&#39;s ideas by how interested I am in it. From there I&#39;ll reach out to the client with the highest scoring idea.</p>
                    <p>When I reach out to you via your designated point of contact, I give you three (3) day for a response. If I get none, I&#39;ll mark you as away until either you respond or I run out of slots.</p>
                    <p>When I run out of slots, I&#39;ll post an announcement via my art galleries or my discord name, though it&#39;s not too late to get picked at this point; I&#39;ll reach out to the next person if slots open up.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>3. Discuss Details</summary>
                    <p>After we confirm contact with can discuss finer details as necessary (references, poses, descriptions) and I&#39;ll send you a quote and invoice for the commission. </p>
                    <p>It&#39;d be a good idea to tell me what the technically requirements need of the commission. For example, if you&#39;re gonna be posting it to Fur Affinity, they have a max resolution for their uploads.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>4. Send Payment</summary>
                    <h2 id="cash">Cash</h3>
                    <p>All cash payments/refunds will be done through PayPal.</p>
                    <p>Payments for the commission can be done all at once or in segments as indicated in the invoice or as described below.</p>
                    <p>I will only do work on a given segment after payment of that section.</p>
                    <h2 id="art-trades">Art Trades</h3>
                    <p>For my artistically-inclined Oomfies, if you (and I) are feeling up to it, we can discuss doing an art trade instead.</p>
                    <p>Let it be known that I wouldn&#39;t recommend commissioning me if you fully intend on doing an art trade as payment as you will likely be disappointed.</p>

                    <summary>5. I Draw The Thing</summary>
                    <p>From here, work on the piece in the order previously described. There&#39;s a lot of communication in the beginning as try to get a feel for what you want. There&#39;s usually a good bit of silence as I work but I&#39;ll post updates or ask questions from time-to-time.</p>
                    <p>Minor changes are free before I start doing the linework. </p>
                    <p>Major changes may incur additional costs or cancellation of the commission.</p>
                    <p>Any changes or opinions I present will incur no costs if taken.</p>

                    <p>If there are any technical troubles, feel free to contact me and I&#39;ll see what I can do.</p>

                    <p>When/If I post your commission, I&#39;ll include your handle(s) of choice (unless you choose to remain anonymous)</p>
